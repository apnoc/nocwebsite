                  12th August 2021: Indian Institute of Technology and Vellore
                  Institute of Technology (VIT), are collaborating with Queen
                  Mary University of London (QMUL), the UK, to develop
                  India-centric Air Sanitization Technologies and guidelines to
                  prevent the spread of Coronavirus and Tuberculosis. This
                  system is aimed at deployment in confined indoor places such
                  as offices and hospitals.

                  <br />
                  This project has major funding from Royal Academy Engineering
                  (RAENG), UK, under the 'Transforming System through
                  Partnership' scheme. The total budget of the project is about
                  A80,000, and it is for a period of two years (April-2021 to
                  April-2023). Partial funding support is also made by the
                  participating organizations.

                  The UK's counterpart Dr. Eldad Avital of Queen Mary University
                  of London said, "Designing any practical system needs a
                  multidisciplinary team. Eventually, we got experts from
                  electronic and electrical system designers, microbiologists
                  and fluid system designers. Sars-Cov-2 spreads quickly and new
                  variants are evolving as we have seen delta and other
                  variants. We need to proceed to the right technology to
                  contain, disinfect it. Our solution will work, in general, for
                  air disinfection for indoor conditions".

                  Mr. Himanshu Agarwal, the CEO of Magneto Cleantech, the Indian
                  industry Partner based in New Delhi, and Mr. Bhanu Agarwal,
                  the co-founder, will provide the overall air conditioning
                  systems design guidance. They will also provide the necessary
                  oversight to ensure an overall system design that meets the
                  needs of practical buildings and air conditioning systems in
                  India. Magneto will also apply the system to client sites and
                  assess the performance of the designed system.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Mr. Himanshu Agarwal said, "The most difficult task for air
                  purification systems in the subcontinent is to tackle the
                  heavy pollution and airborne contaminant load, requiring a
                  robust design and regular cleaning. Our effort will be to come
                  up with a feasible solution which will conform to industry
                  regulations and can benefit the masses with real-time
                  visibility."

                  <br />
                  This research will also involve a strong educational training
                  element giving opportunities to students from both India and
                  the U.K. to collaborate towards solving acute problems
                  affecting societies worldwide.

                  The Academic partners in India are Prof. Abdus Samad from and
                  Prof. Nithya Venkatesan, from VIT, Prof. Abdus Samad will lead
                  the team for the whole system design and overall coordination.
                  Prof. Nithya Venkatesan will focus on electrical components
                  and IoT design.

                  The UK team is led by Dr. Eldad Avital from Queen Mary
                  University of London, with Prof. Clive Beggs of Leeds Beckett
                  University being the project consultant. Dr. Eldad will
                  coordinate the UK team and will look after the fluid mechanics
                  and mathematical modelling. Prof Beggs (an Emeritus professor)
                  will look after the microbiology and UVC.
